# MCMC Fitting & Scaling Method (Astrophysics)

This repository contains reproducible code and notebooks for MCMC-based parameter inference in astrophysics.  
It focuses on two related topics:

- **MCMC scaling method** for estimating black hole masses from X-ray binary spectral parameters (two files / notebook).
- **MCMC for cosmological parameter estimation** (one file / notebook).
- **Data selection & preprocessing** used to prepare the samples for scaling-curve fitting (one file / notebook).
